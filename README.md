## Getting Started

1. Install the latest [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
1. Clone the project
1. Run `Infrastructure.DbUp` console project
1. Run `WebAPI` project

### Database Configuration

The API uses `PostgreSQL` database.<br/>
`DbUp` is used for database schema change management.

Prerequisites:
1. Install `PostreSQL` database locally
1. Install [pgAdmin4]("https://www.pgadmin.org/download/") to manage PostreSQL databases

Update **Infrastructure.DbUp/appsettings.json** as follows:
* Verify that the **DefaultConnection** connection string within **appsettings.json** points to a valid PostgreSQL Server instance. 
* When you run the application the database will be automatically created (if necessary) and the latest migrations will be applied.

Update **WebAPI/appsettings.json** as follows:

* Verify that the **DefaultConnection** connection string within **appsettings.json** points to the same PostgreSQL Server instance as in **Infrastructure.DbUp/appsettings.json**. 

## Overview

### Domain

This will contain all entities, enums, exceptions, interfaces, types and logic specific to the domain layer.

### Application

This layer contains all application logic. It is dependent on the domain layer, but has no dependencies on any other layer or project. This layer defines interfaces that are implemented by outside layers. For example, if the application need to access a notification service, a new interface would be added to application and an implementation would be created within infrastructure.

### Infrastructure

This layer contains classes for accessing external resources such as file systems, web services, smtp, and so on. These classes should be based on interfaces defined within the application layer.

### WebAPI

This layer depends on both the Application and Infrastructure layers, however, the dependency on Infrastructure is only to support dependency injection. Therefore only *Startup.cs* should reference Infrastructure. When run, it opens a Swagger API documentation page.

## Others

* CORS support: In `WebAPI/appsettings.json`, property `CorsOrigins` contains allowed origins separated by comma. 
* Security Headers middleware that adds some security headers.
* Health endpoint that can be found at `{app_url}/health` -> It tests if the application and the database are alive.

## Testing (TBD)
* Unit tests: TBD
* Integration tests: TBD
